# Movies-ETL

## Overview
In this project, I am using Jupyter Notebook and PostGreSQL to clean and query movie data (including Wikipedia, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens rating data) for a hackathon. This particular code includes a function so that the data can be updated daily and be automatically be cleaned and queried appropriately.
